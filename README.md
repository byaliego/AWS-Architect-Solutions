    ❓ A telecommunications company is planning to give AWS Console access to developers. Company policy mandates the use of identity federation and role-based access control. Currently, the roles are already assigned using groups in the corporate Active Directory.
    In this scenario, what kind of the services can provide developers access to the AWS console? </summary>
    </br>
    Considering that the company is using a corporate Active Directory, it is best to use AWS Directory Service AD Connector for easier integration.    In addition, since the roles are already assigned using groups in the corporate Active Directory, it would be better to also use IAM Roles. Take note that you can assign an IAM Role to the users or groups from your Active Directory once it is integrated with your VPC via the AWS Directory Service AD Connector.
